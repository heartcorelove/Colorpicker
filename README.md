# Colorpicker
I was tired of the tiny 50 pixels by 50 pixels square. So I made my own. all written with jQuery, html and css.

#Color.js
Beneath will folow a general introduction to what each function does and what's special about them.

#loadIn
The function loadIn is used to set up the 3 sliders, one for each color in RGB (So Red, Blue and Green).

#makeSlide
The function makeSlide is basically there to be sure the sliders are able to slide, and they get a starting value of rgb(255,140,60). This gives an orange-like color.

#addColorToBackground
The function addColorToBackground is basically just putting the chosen color to the background. So you get a visual. This happens everytime the slider slides!

#addColorRandomColorToBackground
The function addColorRandomColorToBackground gives you a random color to the background. This function can be called when you're complete helpless to which color to pick.
